Geant4 Application to simulate 128 nm photons AAr Instrumentation for Legend-1000.

Two different designs for light collection are implemented:
- baseline: 12 small acrylic bars serve as light guide and are placed on the front surface of the moderator panel; 
- alternative the acrylic moderator panel itself serves as a light guide, readout is to be placed at the top and at the bottom of the panel (deprected).
