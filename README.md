# readout-sim
Geant4 Application for simulating Atm-Argon Instrumentation of Legend-1000.

Two different designs for light collection are implemented:
- baseline: 12 small acrylic bars serves as light guide and are placed on the front surface of the moderator panel; 
- alternative the acrylic moderator panel itself serves as a light guide, readout is to be placed at the top and at the bottom of the panel.

The possibility to also add 2 cladding layers around the light guide (both baseline and alternative) is implemented.
